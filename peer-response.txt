Matt Frix's Feedback of my website: 

Hey, Aj, cool website! I love the idea, and you made great use of flex boxes with your changes in version two!
- Your website demonstrates excellent responsiveness.
- Some readers, myself included, will greatly appreciate your use of a larger font size.
- It may be beneficial to consider a gradient background, perhaps something just off-white, to enhance contrast while making it easier on the eyes.
- I suggest reducing the size of the navigation bar by decreasing the padding around the links.
- I encountered an issue with video playback. Error: 'No video with supported format and MIME type found'. It may be because the video is encoded in H.265, which is not supported by all modern browsers.
- I appreciate the inclusion of the 'Return to top' links. They are very effective, and I'm going to steal them!
- The marquee is very cool and funny!

My Comments and the things I changed: 

Changes:

- Changed the video encoding setting to be H.264 and not the H.265
	- According to Google the H.264 should be supported by most browsers 

- Changed the background color from white to a grey color to make it easier on the eyes
	- I agree with this even though I think the white is more asthetically pleasing. I didn't go with the gradient because I felt it would be to distracting from the text.

My comments: 

- I feel the nav bar is a good size. It is a little big when on mobile but I feel it helps make the buttons eaiser to press. Especially for one handed use. 

- I feel my text size is very readable. At least on my monitors. This is tested on a 15 in laptop and then 2 1440p monitors and a iPhone 13 Pro Max
